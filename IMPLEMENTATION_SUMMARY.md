# Project Money Tracker Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive project-based spending tracking with PDF converter migration, live currency conversion, checkpoint-based metadata storage, and automated report generation.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File:** `app/core/storage.py`

- ✅ Added `Project` model with fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_active`
- ✅ Added `project_id` foreign key to `Run` model
- ✅ Created migration to add `project_id` column to existing runs table
- ✅ Implemented `_ensure_default_project()` to create "Default Project" and assign existing runs
- ✅ Updated `record_run()` to accept and auto-assign project_id from active project

**New CRUD Functions:**
- `create_project(name, description)` - Create new project
- `list_projects()` - List all projects
- `get_project_by_id(project_id)` - Get project by ID
- `get_project_by_name(name)` - Get project by name
- `get_active_project()` - Get currently active project
- `set_active_project(project_id)` - Set active project (deactivates others)
- `update_project(project_id, **fields)` - Update project fields
- `delete_project(project_id)` - Delete project (with safeguards)
- `get_project_stats(project_id)` - Get comprehensive project statistics

### 2. Checkpoint Enhancements
**File:** `app/core/checkpoints.py`

- ✅ Extended checkpoint JSON schema to include project context and processing stats
- ✅ Added `set_project_context(project_id, project_name)` method
- ✅ Added `update_processing_stats(tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd)` method
- ✅ Added `get_processing_stats()` method to retrieve stats
- ✅ Checkpoint now tracks:
  - `project_id` and `project_name`
  - `total_images`, `images_processed`, `images_failed`
  - `total_tokens_input`, `total_tokens_output`
  - `total_cost_usd`, `avg_cost_per_image`

### 3. Live Currency API Integration
**New File:** `app/core/currency_live.py`

- ✅ Implemented live exchange rate fetching using exchangerate-api.com (free tier, no API key)
- ✅ 1-hour cache to minimize API calls (`data/currency_cache.json`)
- ✅ Fallback chain: cached rate → live API → stale cache → user-set rate
- ✅ Functions:
  - `fetch_live_rate()` - Fetch from API
  - `get_cached_rate()` - Get cached rate if fresh
  - `save_cache()` - Save rate to cache
  - `get_rate_with_fallback()` - Smart fallback chain
  - `force_refresh()` - Force API refresh

**Updated File:** `app/core/currency.py`
- ✅ Integrated live rates as primary source
- ✅ Kept manual override option for offline/fallback scenarios

**Updated:** `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Added `requests>=2.31.0` for API calls

### 4. PDF Converter Migration

### 5. Project Selector in Sidebar
**File:** `app/main.py`

- ✅ Added project selector dropdown in sidebar

- ✅ Real-time project statistics:
  - Total images processed
  - Total runs
  - Total cost (USD + INR with live rates)
  - Average cost per image (USD + INR)
- ✅ Auto-switches project on selection change
- ✅ Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### 6. Project Management UI
**File:** `app/pages/2_Settings.py`

  - Create new project with name and description
  - List all projects with stats (images, cost)
  - Edit project details inline
  - Set active project
  - Generate project report
  - Delete project (with safeguards preventing deletion of projects with runs)
  - Visual indicator for active project (🟢)

### 7. Processing Integration
**File:** `app/pages/1_Upload_and_Process.py`

- ✅ Per-file processing tracks:
  - Tokens (input/output) per image
  - Cost per image
  - Cumulative stats in checkpoint
- ✅ Project context automatically set in checkpoints
- ✅ All runs auto-associated with active project
- ✅ Checkpoint stats updated incrementally during processing
- ✅ Project report auto-generated after per-file processing completes

### 8. Report Generation
**New File:** `app/core/report_generator.py`

- ✅ Comprehensive markdown report generator
- ✅ Combines data from:
  - Database runs for project
  - Checkpoint data (if available)
  - Live currency rates
- ✅ Report sections:
  - Project name and description
  - Summary (images processed, failed, tokens)
  - Cost analysis (USD + INR with live rates)
  - Average cost per image
  - Models used
  - Model pricing details
  - Processing timeline
  - Checkpoint details
- ✅ Saved to `export/report_{project_name}_{timestamp}.md`
- ✅ Available via:
  - Auto-generation after per-file processing
  - Manual "Generate Report" button in Projects tab

### 9. Currency Display Updates

- ✅ All cost displays show both USD and INR using live rates
- ✅ Updated locations:
  - Sidebar project stats (main.py)
  - Processing results (1_Upload_and_Process.py)
  - Model registry pricing (2_Settings.py)
  - Project reports
- ✅ Format: `$0.0045 (≈ ₹0.37 INR)` with live rate
- ✅ Graceful fallback when rate unavailable

### 10. Migration & Initialization

- ✅ Automatic database migration adds `project_id` column to runs table
- ✅ Default Project created on first launch
- ✅ All existing runs assigned to Default Project
- ✅ No data loss during migration
